    **Update:**
    `!cd` & `!remove` now tag you if you do not specifically mention a name
    Huggles now properly works across multiple servers with each their own data
    Huggles has a brain now, it can store data in files meaning restarts does not wipe everything
    Easy addition to dialogues, if you have any suggestions let me know

    **Addition**
    You can now whack people with `!tail 'name'`
    
    **Todo**
    Creating a command to set the channel for Huggles to talk in. Servers currently _need_ a 'general' text channel for him to work.
